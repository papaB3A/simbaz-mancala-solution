## Introduction
Mancala is derived from the Arabic word "naqala," meaning "to move." 
The game involves capturing beads or stones by moving them around a series 
of pits and mancalas (larger pits) on the board. This project recreates the Mancala board and gameplay using 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Game Rules
1. The Mancala board consists of two rows of six pits, with a mancala (store) at each end.
2. Players take turns selecting a pit on their side and distributing the beads counterclockwise around the board.
3. Players may drop beads into their own mancala but must skip over their opponent's mancala.
4. The game ends when one player has no more stones on their side. The player with the most stones in their mancala wins.

For a full explanation of the rules, please refer to the [Rules Section](#how-to-play).

## Features and Future Implemetations
- Fully interactive board with clickable pits.
- Simple, elegant design using CSS and W3CSS framework.
- Automated bead distribution for both players.
- Winning logic based on Mancala rules.
- Restart functionality to reset the game.
- Instructions section to guide new players.

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- Optional: A text editor (VSCode, Sublime, etc.) if you want to modify the project.

### Installation
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:papaB3A/simbaz-mancala-solution.git

## Technologies Used
HTML: Markup for structuring the game interface.
CSS: For styling and layout, including W3CSS for quick responsiveness.
JavaScript: Game logic and interaction handling.
jQuery: DOM manipulation and event handling.

## How to Play
1. On your turn, click on one of the pits on your side of the board (bottom row for Player 1, top row for Player 2).
2. The beads in the selected pit will be distributed one by one into the subsequent pits, moving counterclockwise.
3. If the last bead lands in your own mancala, you get another turn.
4. If the last bead lands in an empty pit on your side, and the opposite pit has beads, you capture both the beads from your pit and the opposite pit and place them into your mancala.
5. The game ends when a player has no more beads in any of their pits.
6. The player with the most beads in their mancala wins!
